She is typically described as the spirit of a young girl who haunts school bathrooms, specifically appearing in the third stall from the entrance when summoned through a specific ritual. Despite variations in her backstory and appearance across different schools and regions, certain elements remain remarkably consistent: her manifestation in school restrooms, her red skirt, her association with the number three, and the ritual required to summon her."
